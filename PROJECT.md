Project Overview

Introduction
You are an Enterprise AI Solutions Architect at NovaMart, a fictional e-commerce company. The company's customer support team handles thousands of requests daily — order status inquiries, return and refund requests, policy questions, and more. Currently, support agents manually look up orders, cross-reference policies, and draft responses — a process that is slow, inconsistent, and error-prone.

Your job is to build the AI layer that automates this workflow.

The Challenge
NovaMart needs a customer support system that can automatically understand a customer's request, gather relevant information from multiple data sources, make decisions based on company policies, and compose a professional response — all without human intervention. The system must handle multiple types of requests (order lookups, refund decisions, policy questions) by routing them to the right specialist, enforce enterprise safety guardrails, and provide full observability into every decision the AI makes.

Your Product
You will build a production-grade multi-agent customer support system using Amazon Bedrock AgentCore and the Strands Agents SDK. The system consists of five AI agents working together in an Orchestrator → Workers hierarchy:

An Orchestrator Agent that understands customer intent and routes requests to the right specialist
An Inventory Agent that retrieves order and customer data from DynamoDB
A Policy Agent that answers policy questions using parallel multi-agent RAG across three Knowledge Bases
A Refund Agent that makes return eligibility decisions based on order data and policy rules
A Communication Agent that composes the final customer-facing response
The system is deployed to AgentCore Runtime with Bedrock Guardrails for safety, session memory for multi-turn conversations, and CloudWatch/X-Ray observability for monitoring and debugging.

Deliverables
To complete this project, you must submit:

Completed src/agent_orchestrator.py — All TODO items implemented (Tasks 2, 3, 4, 6)
Three Bedrock Knowledge Bases — Created in the AWS Console with synced data sources (Task 5)
Populated .env file — With your Knowledge Base IDs, AgentCore Runtime ARN, and Guardrail configuration
X-Ray Service Map screenshot — Showing the full trace of an end-to-end request through your multi-agent system (Task 6)

Environment Setup

Project Environment
Provided below is a Udacity workspace with Python and all required dependencies pre-installed. The workspace contains the starter project folder with everything you need to begin.

The project includes a CloudFormation stack that provisions the AWS resources your agents will use. You need to deploy this stack before starting any implementation work. You can find the files in this directory

The stack (infrastructure/starter_stack.yaml) creates:

DynamoDB tables: udacity-agentcore-orders, udacity-agentcore-customers, udacity-agentcore-workflow-state
S3 bucket: for policy documents. The AgentCore CLI stores its deployment package in the CDK bootstrap assets bucket, created on the first runtime deployment.
S3 Vectors: a vector bucket with three vector indexes (returns-policy-index, shipping-policy-index, warranty-policy-index) — the backing store for the three Knowledge Bases
IAM role: Execution role for the AgentCore Runtime with permissions for Bedrock, Knowledge Bases, DynamoDB, S3, S3 Vectors, CloudFormation, CloudWatch, and X-Ray
CloudWatch: Log group for agent execution logs


Deploy the stack using the reference that I'll provide

System Architecture

Overview
Your system should follow an Orchestrator → Workers pattern where a central Orchestrator Agent routes customer requests to specialist worker agents. Each worker should operate on a specific domain (inventory, policy, refunds, communication) and write its findings to a shared DynamoDB WorkflowState record.

Agent Graph

Request Flow
The sequence diagram below shows how a typical return request should flow through the system:
/Users/guigasque/GitHub/aws-multi-agent-customer-service-system/RequestFlow.png

Shared WorkflowState
The WorkflowState record in DynamoDB should use optimistic locking — each update should include an expected_version that must match the current version. This prevents concurrent agents from overwriting each other's results.

CommunicationAgent	Claude 4.5 Sonnet	Drafts final, empathetic customer-facing response	get_full_workflow_context

Phase 1 - Build the Multi-Agent Graph

File: src/agent_orchestrator.py

In this phase, you will implement five Strands Agents that form an Orchestrator → Workers hierarchy. This is the core of the project — by the end of this phase, you will have a working multi-agent system that can route customer requests, retrieve data, make decisions, and compose responses.

Your Files
File	Role	Action
src/agent_orchestrator.py	Main implementation file — agent builders, routing tools, deployment	Implement TODOs
src/agent_utils.py	Terminal trace UI, ANSI colours, AgentTrace class	Do not modify
src/agent_observability.py	X-Ray tracing (@tool wrapper) and CloudWatch logging	Do not modify
src/bedrock_kb_retrieval.py	KB retrieval helper used by PolicyAgent	Do not modify
src/demo.py	Runs one end-to-end request for local testing	Do not modify
config.py	Central configuration — reads CloudFormation exports + .env	Do not modify
tests/test_agent.py	Automated test suite	Do not modify
src/agentcore_cli.py	AgentCore CLI wrapper: stage code, configure, deploy, read runtime ARN	Do not modify
What is agent_utils.py? It contains the terminal trace UI that makes agent activity visible during chat and demo runs — colour-coded step banners, tool call formatting, parallel retrieval display, and the DynamoDB workflow summary. You do not need to read or understand it to complete the project.

What is agent_observability.py? It provides the tool decorator used in agent_orchestrator.py — the Strands @tool plus an X-Ray subsegment per call — so every request you run is traced to AWS X-Ray automatically (Phase 4). Use @tool exactly as you would with Strands.

Background: Strands Agents
The Strands Agents SDK(opens in a new tab) lets you build AI agents by decorating Python functions with @tool and passing them to an Agent along with a model and system prompt. When called like a function, the agent reasons through the problem and invokes its tools as needed. Refer to the SDK documentation for usage details.

Background: WorkflowState
WorkflowStateTable is a shared DynamoDB record (keyed by session_id) that accumulates each worker's output as the request flows through the pipeline. Three pre-written helpers manage it — use them inside your routing tools:

_create_workflow_state(session_id, customer_id) — creates a blank record
_read_workflow_state(session_id) — reads the current state
_update_workflow_state(session_id, updates, expected_version) — writes with optimistic locking
1.A — InventoryAgent
Build a worker agent that gathers order and customer facts from DynamoDB. It should NOT make decisions — only report what it finds.

Implement three tools that look up data from the DynamoDB tables provisioned by the CloudFormation stack you deployed earlier. Use config.ORDERS_TABLE and config.CUSTOMERS_TABLE for the table names. Note that the Orders table has a composite key (customer_id + order_id), which is why the check_order_status stub takes both. Write a system prompt that instructs the agent to be a data gatherer — it should retrieve information accurately and never make eligibility decisions.

Model: config.WORKER_MODEL_ID (Claude Sonnet 4.5), Temperature: 0.1
1.B — RefundAgent
Build a worker agent that makes return/refund eligibility decisions. It reads facts from WorkflowState (populated by InventoryAgent) and applies the correct policy window based on customer tier.

Policy windows: Standard customers = 30 days, Premium customers = 60 days.

Implement two tools: one that reads the inventory findings from WorkflowState, and one that processes the return by updating the order record in DynamoDB. Write a system prompt that instructs the agent on the decision process — it should always check inventory context first, then apply the correct return window.

Model: config.WORKER_MODEL_ID, Temperature: 0.1
1.C — PolicyAgent — Multi-Agent RAG
Build a coordinator agent that answers policy questions by running three specialized retriever sub-agents in parallel. This is the core architectural pattern of this project.

Inside build_policy_agent(), create three retriever sub-agents — one for each policy domain (Returns, Shipping, Warranty). Each retriever should have a single tool that calls retrieve_from_knowledge_base() (imported from bedrock_kb_retrieval.py) with the appropriate Knowledge Base ID from config.

Then implement the search_all_policies tool that invokes all three retrievers simultaneously using ThreadPoolExecutor and collects their results. The trace calls in the starter code show you where the parallel execution should happen.

Finally, create the PolicyAgent coordinator with a system prompt that instructs it to always call search_all_policies first, then synthesize the retrieved passages into a grounded answer.

Retrievers: config.WORKER_MODEL_ID, Temperature: 0.0 (deterministic retrieval)
PolicyAgent coordinator: config.WORKER_MODEL_ID, Temperature: 0.2
1.D — CommunicationAgent
Build a worker agent that drafts the final customer-facing response. It reads the full WorkflowState (all findings from previous agents) and composes a professional, empathetic message.

Implement one tool that reads the complete WorkflowState record. Write a system prompt that instructs the agent to include all relevant information from previous agents and maintain a warm, professional tone.

Model: config.WORKER_MODEL_ID, Temperature: 0.3 (for warm, natural tone)
1.E — OrchestratorAgent
Build the orchestrator that routes requests and manages WorkflowState. This agent does not answer questions directly — it delegates everything to the appropriate specialist.

Implement five routing tools: initialize_session, route_to_inventory_agent, route_to_policy_agent, route_to_refund_agent, and route_to_communication_agent. Each routing tool should read the current WorkflowState, invoke the appropriate worker agent, and then update the WorkflowState with the result.

Write a system prompt that enforces these routing rules:

Rule	Trigger	Action
1	Every request, always	Call initialize_session first
2	Order status / return / refund requests	Route to inventory agent first, then refund agent
3	Policy meaning questions (return windows, shipping rates, warranty terms)	Route to policy agent
4	Account questions ("what is my tier?", "am I premium?")	Route to inventory agent — never policy agent (it only knows policy text, not customer data)
5	Math / calculation questions	Orchestrator → CommunicationAgent, skip Inventory, Policy and Refund.
6	Every request, always (last step)	Route to communication agent to compose the final reply
CRITICAL: The Orchestrator must never write the final customer-facing response itself. It must always delegate to the communication agent as its very last tool call — no exceptions.

Model: config.ORCHESTRATOR_MODEL_ID (Claude Haiku 4.5 — fast, cost-efficient)
Temperature: 0.0 (deterministic routing)
Test Your Work
python tests/test_agent.py task2
For a live end-to-end test, three modes are available:

# Single pre-scripted request — runs one full refund scenario
python src/demo.py

# Runs 3 hardcoded scenarios and prints raw responses
python src/agent_orchestrator.py test

# Interactive terminal chat — type queries and watch the live trace
python src/agent_orchestrator.py chat
Tips
The orchestrator should have temperature=0.0 — deterministic routing is critical
Each @tool function's docstring is what the agent reads to decide when to use it — write clear docstrings
For the PolicyAgent retrievers: you are creating agents INSIDE build_policy_agent(). Each retriever is a full Strands Agent instance
Don't forget to return Agent(...) at the end of each build function

Phase 2 - Deployment

File: src/agent_orchestrator.py

In this phase, implement the functions that create the guardrail, deploy the runtime and configure Memory. Do not run the full deployment yet. First complete these functions, then continue to Phase 3 to create the Knowledge Bases and Phase 4 to implement observability. You will deploy and test the complete system in Phase 4.

Task 3 — Guardrail and Runtime Deployment
Background
Bedrock Guardrails(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/guardrails-create.html) filter model inputs and outputs. AgentCore Runtime(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/agent-runtime.html) hosts your agent application. This project deploys the runtime using the AgentCore CLI, through the supplied src/agentcore_cli.py helper.

Implement create_guardrail()
Create a Bedrock Guardrail using the bedrock client with these policies:

Content policy: SEXUAL, VIOLENCE and HATE at HIGH strength; INSULTS and MISCONDUCT at MEDIUM strength.
PII policy: BLOCK credit card numbers and SSNs; ANONYMIZE emails and phone numbers.
Topic policy: DENY competitor products, pricing negotiations and legal threats.
Word policy: Enable the managed profanity list.
Include friendly blocked messages for both inputs and outputs.
For the topic policy, use topicPolicyConfig.tierConfig = {"tierName": "STANDARD"} and top-level crossRegionConfig = {"guardrailProfileIdentifier": "us.guardrail.v1:0"}. Define pricing negotiations as haggling or requests to change an advertised price, while allowing calculations using a specified price and discount. This avoids the false positive observed with the project's math scenario on the Classic tier.

Publish a numbered version with create_guardrail_version() and return (guardrail_id, guardrail_version). Use that numbered version, not DRAFT. During final testing, verify that the math question and its answer are allowed and that negotiation, competitor and legal-threat examples are blocked.

Implement deploy_to_agentcore_runtime()
The supplied code stages your application and helper modules in build/runtime/. Complete the TODO to:

Build the runtime environment variables: AWS_REGION, PROJECT_NAME, RETURNS_KB_ID, SHIPPING_KB_ID, WARRANTY_KB_ID, AGENT_LOG_GROUP, GUARDRAIL_ID and GUARDRAIL_VERSION.
Pass them to agentcore_cli.configure_runtime() with network_mode='PUBLIC', protocol='HTTP' and execution_role_arn=config.AGENTCORE_ROLE_ARN.
Call agentcore_cli.deploy(). The CLI packages the application and deploys it through CloudFormation.
Read the ARN with agentcore_cli.deployed_runtime_arn() and return it.
Do not implement a direct create_agent_runtime() SDK call. The supplied _apply_guardrail() applies the guardrail to each agent's model using the ID and version provided in the runtime environment variables.

Task 4 — Memory
Background
AgentCore Memory(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/memory.html) provides storage for conversation context. This task configures a Memory resource with a session-summary strategy and seven-day event retention.

Implement configure_memory(runtime_arn)
Create the resource with agentcore_control.create_memory(), using the summaryMemoryStrategy and eventExpiryDuration=7. The supplied code waits for the resource to become ACTIVE; return its ARN.

Next step
Continue to Phase 3 — Knowledge Bases, then implement observability in Phase 4. The full deployment calls both the Memory and Observability functions and requires all three Knowledge Base IDs. Phase 4 contains the deployment and test commands.

Phase 3 - Knowledge Bases

Location: AWS Console (no code changes required)

In this phase, you will create three Bedrock Knowledge Bases — one per policy domain. These are the data sources that power the parallel multi-agent RAG system you built in Phase 1.

Background: Bedrock Knowledge Bases with S3 Vectors
A Knowledge Base is a managed RAG service — point it at an S3 prefix and Bedrock handles chunking, embedding (Titan Embed Text v2), and vector indexing into S3 Vectors (serverless, no OpenSearch needed). S3 Vectors is a separate service from general-purpose S3: a Knowledge Base needs a vector bucket and one vector index per KB. Your CloudFormation stack created both — run python config.py to see their names. The bedrock-agent-runtime.retrieve() API returns the top-k relevant passages. See: Bedrock Knowledge Bases(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base.html)

Step 1: Verify policy documents
The policy documents were uploaded to S3 when you ran seed_data.py during environment setup. They are organized under three prefixes:

s3://{policy-docs-bucket}/policies/returns/    ← returns policy documents
s3://{policy-docs-bucket}/policies/shipping/   ← shipping policy documents
s3://{policy-docs-bucket}/policies/warranty/   ← warranty policy documents
You can verify in the AWS Console:

Navigate to AWS Console → S3
Open the bucket named udacity-agentcore-policy-docs-{ACCOUNT_ID}-{suffix} (the exact name is the Policy Bucket line of python config.py)
Navigate to the policies/ prefix
Verify you see three folders: returns/, shipping/, warranty/, each containing policy documents
Alternatively, in AWS CloudShell (browser-based shell with AWS CLI pre-installed):

aws s3 ls s3://$(python -c "import config; print(config.POLICY_BUCKET)")/policies/ --recursive
Step 2: Create three Knowledge Bases in the AWS Console
Navigate to: AWS Console → Amazon Bedrock → Knowledge Bases → Create Knowledge Base

Create three KBs with these settings (one per domain):

Setting	Returns KB	Shipping KB	Warranty KB
Name	novamart-returns-policy-kb	novamart-shipping-policy-kb	novamart-warranty-policy-kb
S3 data source prefix	policies/returns/	policies/shipping/	policies/warranty/
Embedding model	Amazon Titan Embed Text v2	Amazon Titan Embed Text v2	Amazon Titan Embed Text v2
Vector store	S3 Vectors → Use an existing vector bucket	same	same
S3 Vectors bucket	Vector Bucket from python config.py (udacity-agentcore-vectors-…)	same	same
Vector index	returns-policy-index	shipping-policy-index	warranty-policy-index
Do not choose Managed KB — that creates a different vector bucket than the one the project (and the rubric) expects, and the backing store cannot be changed afterwards. Use Self-managed KBs.

After creating each KB, click Sync to index the documents.

Step 3: Add KB IDs to your .env
Copy each Knowledge Base ID from the console and add to your .env:

RETURNS_KB_ID=<your-returns-kb-id>
SHIPPING_KB_ID=<your-shipping-kb-id>
WARRANTY_KB_ID=<your-warranty-kb-id>
Test your work
python tests/test_agent.py task5
Tips
After creating a KB, you MUST click "Sync" before queries will return results
If retrieval returns empty results, check that your KB IDs in .env match the console
The S3 Vectors bucket and the three indexes were already created by the CloudFormation stack you deployed earlier; python tests/test_agent.py task5 reports which vector store each KB uses

Phase 4 - Observability & Testing

File: src/agent_orchestrator.py

In this final phase, you will enable observability for your deployed agent system and run the end-to-end submission tests.

Task 6 — Observability
Background: AgentCore Observability
AgentCore Observability routes execution data to CloudWatch Logs (reasoning chains, tool calls, responses) and AWS X-Ray (distributed latency traces across the full Orchestrator → Worker call chain). See: AgentCore Observability(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability.html)

What to implement
configure_observability(runtime_arn)

Configure logging and tracing for the AgentCore runtime by building a loggingConfiguration dict and passing it to the pre-written apply_observability_config():

CloudWatch Logs (cloudWatchConfig): Point to config.AGENT_LOG_GROUP, set INFO-level logging, enable it
X-Ray (xRayConfig): Enable tracing with 100% sampling rate
apply_observability_config() turns that into real AWS state: it enables CloudWatch Transaction Search (the mechanism AgentCore Observability uses) at the sampling percentage you chose, creates the log group, and stores the settings as environment variables on your runtime so the deployed agent logs and traces exactly as configured.

How traces reach X-Ray. The pre-written agent_observability.py records every request as one X-Ray trace: each route_to_* tool becomes a worker-agent node and each Knowledge Base retrieval a KnowledgeBase:* node. It works the same from your machine (test, chat, demo) and inside the deployed runtime (invoke), so the Service Map below shows the real call chain of your code.

Test your work
python tests/test_agent.py task6
After the automated tests pass, send a test request through the system:

python src/agent_orchestrator.py test
Each scenario prints its X-Ray trace id. Then navigate to AWS Console → CloudWatch → X-Ray traces → Service map (also reachable as X-Ray → Service map) and select Last 5 minutes. You should see a trace graph showing the full call chain from NovaMart-Orchestrator through to the worker agents and Knowledge Bases.

Tips
X-Ray traces may take 30–60 seconds to appear in the console after invocation
Set samplingRate=1.0 during development so every request is traced
End-to-End Submission Test
With all tasks complete, run the full deployment:

python src/agent_orchestrator.py deploy
Test these scenarios manually to verify your system handles all three request types:

Scenario	Expected Routing
"I want to return my order ORD-27176" (as CUST-001)	Orchestrator → Inventory → Refund → Communication
"What is the return policy for premium customers?"	Orchestrator → Policy (3 parallel KB retrievers) → Communication
"How much are 5 items at $29.99 with 10% off?"	Orchestrator → CommunicationAgent; skip Inventory, Policy and Refund.

Run the full test suite one final time:


python tests/test_agent.py all
Required deliverable:

Take a screenshot that shows that all test passed, and shows that you have 120 scores.
Take a screenshot of your X-Ray Service Map after running a live request. Navigate to AWS Console → CloudWatch → X-Ray traces → Service map and capture the full trace graph showing the Orchestrator → Worker call chain.
Clean Up
After you have taken your screenshots and submitted the project, delete everything it created so the AWS account stops incurring charges:

python infrastructure/cleanup.py          # dry run - lists what would be deleted
python infrastructure/cleanup.py --yes    # deletes it


Clean up after submitting. Nothing in the reviewed submission depends on the resources still existing, but you may need them again if the reviewer asks for changes.

Industry Best Practices
Criteria	Submission Requirements
Write clean, modular, and well-documented agent code

Tool functions have docstrings that accurately describe their purpose, parameters, and return values
Agent builder functions (build_*_agent()) are self-contained and each returns exactly one Agent instance
Variable and function names are descriptive and follow Python naming conventions (snake_case)
Apply correct model selection for each agent role

OrchestratorAgent uses config.ORCHESTRATOR_MODEL_ID (Claude Haiku 4.5) for fast, cost-efficient routing
All worker agents use config.WORKER_MODEL_ID (Claude Sonnet 4.5) for higher-quality reasoning
Model selections are not hardcoded - config constants are used throughout
Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out
Run adversarial inputs against the Guardrail (prompt injection attempts, competitor mentions, legal threats) and document how each is handled with screenshots of blocked responses - demonstrating real-world safety validation.



Add persistent conversation memory by creating a DynamoDB `agent-sessions` table and integrating the Strands SDK `DynamoDbSessionStorage` into the Orchestrator - enabling the agent to recall earlier messages in the same chat session without relying solely on AgentCore Memory, and demonstrating how local session storage complements cloud-based memory strategies.
Build a CloudWatch dashboard showing agent invocation count over time, average response latency per agent type, and Guardrail trigger frequency - demonstrating production-grade observability thinking.
Integrate AWS Cognito for customer authentication and build a frontend interface (e.g., using React or a simple HTML/JS page) that connects to the AgentCore Runtime endpoint - transforming the terminal-only system into a fully deployable, user-facing customer support application.
